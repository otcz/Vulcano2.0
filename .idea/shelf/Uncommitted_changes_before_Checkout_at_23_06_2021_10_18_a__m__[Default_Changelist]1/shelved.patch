If set to false, scrolling up means zooming in.\r\n# This property works application wide: all scroll behavior will follow this property. \r\nscrollUpZoomOut=false\r\n\r\n# Defines if System.exit should be called when the application is closed (e.g., by clicking\r\n# File|Exit).  As of Java 1.5, calling System.exit is no longer really needed, and it can be\r\n# convenient not to do so when other applications are running in the same virtual machine.\r\n# Default is true.\r\nsystemExitOnClose=true\r\n\r\n# All menu items added by the lucy frontend or the addons can be configured in the respective\r\n# configuration files.  So the menu items added by the frontend can be configured in this\r\n# configuration file, the menu items added by the map addon can be configured by adapting the\r\n# configuration file of the map addon (see addons.xml to find out which config file belongs to\r\n# which addon), ...\r\n# When configuring actions, TLcyDebugAddOn can be of great help.\r\n#\r\n# For every action added to the menu, these properties can be modified:\r\n# - 'item': Comma separated list of the position in the menu structure. The values are assumed\r\n#           to be in the English language.  If Lucy is running in another language (e.g. Dutch\r\n#           by using virtual machine argument -Duser.language=nl), an attempt will be made to\r\n#           translate these values into the current language.  Therefore the translations must\r\n#           be available in the according translations file (e.g. DefaultResources_nl.properties)\r\n#           E.g. \"File, SomeSubMenu, Exit\" means that an 'Exit' item is added in the\r\n#                'SomeSubMenu' sub menu of the 'File' menu.  If the current language is Dutch,\r\n#                the 'File' will be translated to 'Bestand', and the 'Exit' will translated to\r\n#                'Afsluiten' as indicated in DefaultResources_nl.properties.  The 'SomeSubMenu'\r\n#                will not be translated as no translation is available.\r\n# - 'groups': Comma separated list of the groups used for the item.  The amount of groups\r\n#             should match the amount of items.\r\n#             E.g. \"FileGroup, SomeSubMenuGroup, ExitGroup\" means that the 'Exit' item is\r\n#                  grouped together with other items it that same group.  Groups are\r\n#                  separated by horizontal lines. The 'SomeSubMenu' sub menu will be grouped\r\n#                  together with other items in that same group.  The 'File' menu will be\r\n#                  grouped together with other items in the 'FileGroup'.  Typically there\r\n#                  will not be any more items in the 'FileGroup', so the 'File' menu will be\r\n#                  the only item in its group.  Groups are also used to define an ordering on\r\n#                  the menu bar.  You can find some more information about ordering of groups\r\n#                  below.\r\n# - 'shortDescription': A short description for that action, used as a tooltip. An attempt will\r\n#                       be made to translate this description.\r\n# - 'longDescription': A long description for that action.  Currently not used in the user\r\n#                      interface. An attempt will be made to translate this description.\r\n# - 'smallIcon': The file name of a small image icon (jpg, png, gif).  The file name is\r\n#                relative to the classpath.\r\n# - 'helpID': An ID for context sensitive help. Currently not used in the user interface.\r\n# - 'insert': 'true' or 'false'.  Default is true.  If set to false, the item will not be\r\n#             inserted in the menu bar.\r\n# - 'active': This property is only valid for menu items that have a checkbox or a radio\r\n#             button (called active settable). If set to 'true', the item will be enabled on\r\n#             startup, it set to 'false' the item will be disabled on startup.  The default\r\n#             depends per active settable.\r\n# - 'acceleratorKey': This property is only valid for menu items.  It defines the accelerator\r\n#                     key for some action, e.g. ctrl O for File|Open.  Some examples are\r\n#                     shift S, ctrl L, alt 2, F10, ...  Note that the letter needs to be in uppercase.\r\n#                     The full specification of all possible accelerator keys can be found\r\n#                     at http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/javax/swing/KeyStroke.html#getKeyStroke(java.lang.String)\r\n# - 'default': This property sets the item as the default item. When this item is show in a popupmenu,\r\n#              it will be rendered in bold. Double-clicking the component that owns the popupmenu\r\n#              should automatically execute that action. Note that it is up to the component to implement\r\n#              the latter behaviour -- the Lucy framework can't enforce this. The standard Lucy controls (such as\r\n#              the map layer control and the map component) that show popupmenus have this behaviour.\r\n# - 'showActionName': Only relevant for tool bars. Set to true to make sure tool bar buttons not\r\n#                     only display their icon, but also their action name.\r\n#\r\nTLcyMain.exitAction.menuBar.item=File,Exit\r\nTLcyMain.exitAction.menuBar.groups=FileGroup, ExitGroup\r\nTLcyMain.exitAction.menuBar.smallIcon=\r\n#TLcyMain.exitAction.menuBar.shortDescription=Close application\r\n#TLcyMain.exitAction.menuBar.longDescription=Closes the application.\r\n#TLcyMain.exitAction.menuBar.helpID=EXIT_ID\r\n#TLcyMain.exitAction.menuBar.insert=true\r\n\r\n\r\n# Defines the ordering of the groups in the menu bar.  This ordering will be respected by the\r\n# menu bar.  You can use the ordering to force certain groups to be inserted before or after\r\n# other groups, regardless the moment at which the insertion takes place.\r\n# Groups that are not mentioned in this list will be added after all known groups.  Their\r\n# relative ordering depends on the moment at which the insertion takes place.\r\n#\r\n# Example 1:\r\n# Consider the piece of code below:\r\n#   aLucyEnv.getMainMenuBar().insertAction(\r\n#     someColorAction,\r\n#     new TLcyGroupDescriptor( \"MapColorGroup\" ),\r\n#     new String[] { TLcyLang.getString( \"Map\" ), TLcyLang.getString( \"Colors\" ) },\r\n#     new TLcyGroupDescriptor[] { new TLcyGroupDescriptor( \"MapGroup\", \"MapSubMenuGroup\" ) } );\r\n#\r\n# or its equivalent in a configuration file:\r\n#   TLcySomeAddOn.someColorAction.menuBar.item=Map, Colors, SomeColorActionName\r\n#   TLcySomeAddOn.someColorAction.menuBar.groups=MapGroup, MapSubMenuGroup, MapColorGroup\r\n#\r\n# then the 'someColorAction' will be inserted in the 'Colors' submenu of the\r\n# 'Map' menu.\r\n# If at least one action (or active settable) was added previously (in time) in\r\n# the same 'Map' menu then this menu already exists, and the 'someColorAction'\r\n# will be added to it. Therefore the given group descriptor UID 'MapGroup' is\r\n# not used (it's only used when the menu needs to be created).\r\n# Because it is impossible to know if you are the first one inserting an item\r\n# to a certain menu or not, it's always necessary to provide the group UID.\r\n#\r\n# If no action (or active settable) was added previously (in time) to the 'Map'\r\n# menu, the 'Map' menu will be created. The group descriptor of this 'Map' menu\r\n# ('MapGroup') will define the location where this menu will be added. Suppose\r\n# there are currently two menus: 'File' and 'Tools'. Suppose the 'File' menu was\r\n# added with a 'FileGroup' group UID and the 'Tools' menu was added with a\r\n# 'ToolsGroup' group UID, then this new 'Map' menu with group UID 'MapGroup' will\r\n# be added inbetween those two existing menus, because the priorities below\r\n# indicate that 'FileGroup' comes before 'MapGroup' and that 'MapGroup' comes\r\n# before 'ToolsGroup'.\r\n#\r\n# The reasoning for the sub menu 'Colors' is identical. If the 'Colors'\r\n# sub menu already existed, the action will be added to it, otherwise the\r\n# 'Colors' sub menu will be created. In that case its location will be defined\r\n# by the 'MapSubMenuGroup' group UID.\r\n#\r\n# If at least one action (or active settable) was added previously (in time)\r\n# with the same group descriptor UID 'MapColorGroup' in the same menus ('Map',\r\n# 'Colors'), then this new 'someColorAction' will be added at the bottom of that\r\n# group (groups are separated with separators, horizontal lines). If no actions\r\n# were added before (in time) to this 'MapColorGroup', then the new group will be\r\n# created. The location of this group within the 'Map', 'Colors' menus, is\r\n# defined by its group UID 'MapColorGroup'. Suppose there was already added an\r\n# action in the 'Map', 'Colors' menu with group UID 'NewObjectGroup', then the\r\n# priorities below indicate that the 'MapColorGroup' will be added above that\r\n# action. Therefore the 'someColorAction' will be added above that action.\r\n#\r\n# The order of the items within a group can optionally be configured by adding an appropriate\r\n# sort attribute to the group. The value of the attribute is a name of a \r\n# well known group descriptor sort. For instance, to have the OpenSaveGroup\r\n# sorted with the abc sorter it should be configured as follows.\r\n#\r\n#    OpenSaveGroup;sort=abc,\r\n#\r\n# The names of the most common descriptors are 'abc' (sorts alphabetically),\r\n# 'zyx' (sort alphabetically descending),\r\n# 'subMenusLast' (first all menu items, then the menus), 'subMenusFirst' (first all\r\n# menus, then the menu items), 'start' (new items\r\n# are added at the start), 'end' (new items are added at the end, this is the default)\r\n# and 'fixed'.\r\n# The 'fixed' sort takes a number of additional parameters. These parameters\r\n# correspond to the names of actions, menus or menu items. This sort will\r\n# sort the group according to this list of parameters with all items\r\n# that are not in the list coming at the end. For instance, the following \r\n# configuration will order the workspace group with the \r\n# \"Set default workspace...\" menu item coming first, followed by the\r\n# \"Recent workspaces\" menu and then the rest of the items.\r\n# \r\n#    WorkspaceGroup;sort=fixed:Set default workspace...!Recent workspaces,\\\r\n#\r\n# More information on sorting groups can be found in the Lucy developer guide.\r\n#\r\n# Note how the names of the menus \"Map\" and \"Colors\" are translated using\r\n# TLcyLang.getString in the piece of code, but not in the configuration file.\r\n# In the configuration files, all names of actions and menus must be specified\r\n# in the English language.  They will be translated to the current language\r\n# when the configuration file is read (provided the correct translation file\r\n# is available).  The names of the group descriptors are never translated,\r\n# because these are programmatic names that are never displayed to a user.\r\n#\r\n# Example 2:\r\n# Consider the piece of code below:\r\n#   aLucyEnv.getMainMenuBar().insertAction(\r\n#     someExitAction,\r\n#     new TLcyGroupDescriptor( \"ExitGroup\" ),\r\n#     new String[] { TLcyLang.getString( \"File\" ) },\r\n#     new TLcyGroupDescriptor[] { new TLcyGroupDescriptor( \"FileGroup\" ) } );\r\n#\r\n#   aLucyEnv.getMainMenuBar().insertAction(\r\n#     someOpenAction,\r\n#     new TLcyGroupDescriptor( \"OpenSaveGroup\" ),\r\n#     new String[] { TLcyLang.getString( \"File\" ) },\r\n#     new TLcyGroupDescriptor[] { new TLcyGroupDescriptor( \"FileGroup\" ) } );\r\n#\r\n# or its equivalent in a configuration file:\r\n#   TLcySomeAddOn.someExitAction.menuBar.item=File, SomeExitActionName\r\n#   TLcySomeAddOn.someExitAction.menuBar.groups=FileGroup, ExitGroup\r\n#\r\n#   TLcySomeAddOn.someOpenAction.menuBar.item=File, SomeOpenActionName\r\n#   TLcySomeAddOn.someOpenAction.menuBar.groups=FileGroup, OpenSaveGroup\r\n#\r\n# The 'someOpenAction' will be inserted in the 'File' menu above the\r\n# 'someExitAction', because the priorities below indicate that the\r\n# 'OpenSaveGroup' group should be added above the 'ExitGroup' group. Therefore\r\n# actions belonging to the 'OpenSaveGroup' will be added above actions belonging\r\n# to the 'ExitGroup'.\r\n#\r\n#\r\n# This is a comma separated list of values, which is spread out over several lines.  To be\r\n# able to spread out over multiple lines, one must end every line with a back slash.
