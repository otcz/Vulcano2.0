# Any .jar files needed to compile these source files are expected to be in (a subdirectory of)
# the 'lib' directory.
# If no source files can be found in this folder, or if the folder does not exist, simply no
# additional sources will be compiled nor packaged and the deployed application will only contain
# the addons that are shipped with Lucy. Note that this folder does not exist by default, it
# is up to the customer to create the folder and put his/her custom addons in there.
