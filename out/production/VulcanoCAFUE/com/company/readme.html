      <h3>Explanation</h3>
      <p>
         This sample demonstrates how to determine which files can be opened by Lucy as well as the actual
         opening of those files.
         
      </p>
      <p>Lucy uses two concepts for opening a file:</p>
      <ul>
         
         <li>
            <code>ILcdModelDecoder</code>
            instances are used to convert a source to an<code>ILcdModel</code>. When
            the data needs to be visualized, the model is converted to a layer which can be added to a view. This
            is the same mechanism as available in the core LuciadLightspeed product.
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            <code>ALcyDataSourceHandler</code>
            instances are used to open all other data which do not fit
            in the concept of an<code>ILcdModelDecoder</code>. An example is data originating from a server like a WMS
            server.
            Typically this requires that a connection is set up to the server to see which data is available.
            Then the data is selected, and that data stream can then be visualized on the client side.
            
         </li>
         
      </ul>
      <p>
         Each of the format add-ons registers its model decoders and/or data source handlers to the Lucy
         back-end (see
         <code>TLcyCompositeModelDecoder#addModelDecoder</code>
         and<code>TLcyCompositeDataSourceHandler#addDataSourceHandler</code>).
         Registering such an instance requires to register a matching<code>ALcyFileTypeDescriptor</code>.
         This descriptor allows to quickly filter which files are accepted by the model decoder or data source handler
         through its
         <code>includes</code>
         method.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         This sample illustrates how to use those registered
         <code>ALcyFileTypeDescriptor</code>
         instances
         to determine which files in a certain directory can be opened by Lucy. The configuration file
         allows to specify this directory and search depth. For each of the files in those directories
         a menu-item will be added. When the menu item is clicked, the data is loaded on the map.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         Loading of data in Lucy is the responsibility of the<code>TLcyDataFormatManager</code>. This
         class provides a
         <code>handleDataSources</code>
         method which will load the specified data.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         Notice that opening some files may result in an error. For example a CADGR file and a Dafif file
         both have the extension .toc . Lucy indicates, based on the extension of the file, it can handle the
         file when at least one of the addons responsible for these file types is loaded. So when trying to open a
         Dafif file when this addon is not loaded, an error will be produced since the CADGR decoder does not
         know how to decode a Dafif file.
         
      </p>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <p>
         Use the menu items under the 'Data' menu item to load data onto the currently active GXY map. The data will be
         loaded on
         a background thread when a menu item is clicked. Loading the data on a background thread makes
         sure the Lucy UI remains responsive during the loading of the data.
